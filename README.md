A collection of my practice projects that accumulated overtime. I saw no reason to keep creating different repos per one small project, so desided to create this well structured repo where i could showcase and organize all of projects. This content is available for free for public. Every project was completed personally, but i do not take a credit that is represented within the projects since some of them were done by doing courses such like WesBos, Traversy Media, Code with Tim, Coursera, Udemy etc. the list is endless. Please do not just copy the repo claiming that you've done it all. Peace to everyone!
